### Growth Projections:
| Dataset Size | Response Time | Cache Hit Rate | Status |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| 100K entries | ~125ms | 95% | ✅ Excellent |
| 500K entries | ~280ms | 95% | ✅ Good |
| 1M entries | ~450ms | 93% | ✅ Acceptable |
| 5M entries | ~1.2s | 90% | ⚠️ Consider partitioning |
