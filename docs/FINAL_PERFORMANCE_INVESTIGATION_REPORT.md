# Morfeo Performance Investigation - Final Report

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Investigation:** Elasticsearch 33.6GB RAM usage  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED  
**Recommendation:** Implement direct Entry-Topic associations, then remove ES

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

### The Discovery

Running diagnostics on **local** vs **production** revealed completely different performance characteristics:

| Environment | Scale | Tagging Performance | ES Needed? |
|-------------|-------|---------------------|------------|
| **Local/Dev** | 1K taggings | ‚úÖ 11ms (fast!) | ‚ùå No - overhead |
| **Production** | 3.3M taggings | ‚ùå 440ms (slow!) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently helping, but expensive |

### The Problem

**At production scale (1.7M entries, 3.3M taggings), polymorphic JOINs are expensive:**

```
Without tagging: 246ms (scan 39K entries)
With tagging:    440ms (scan 3.3M taggings + 39K entries)
Overhead:        +194ms (79% slower!)
```

**Elasticsearch bypasses this JOIN:**
- Returns pre-indexed entry IDs
- Avoids 3.3M row tagging scan
- But costs **33.6GB RAM**

###The Solution

**Don't remove ES immediately. First, fix the root cause:**

1. **Implement direct Entry-Topic associations** (eliminate polymorphic JOIN)
2. **Expected performance:** 440ms ‚Üí 50-100ms (88% faster)
3. **Then remove Elasticsearch** (save 33.6GB RAM)
4. **Final state:** Faster queries + zero additional RAM + cleaner code

## üìä Production Performance Data

### Current State

| Query Type | Time | Entries Scanned | Taggings Scanned |
|------------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Baseline (no tags) | 246ms | 39,402 | 0 |
| With tagging (current) | 440ms | 3,976 | 3,300,000 |
| **Overhead** | **+194ms** | **-89% filtered** | **3.3M rows!** |

### Root Cause

**Polymorphic tagging JOIN on 3.3M rows:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT entries.id) 
FROM entries
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT * FROM taggings 
  WHERE taggings.taggable_id = entries.id 
  AND taggings.taggable_type = 'Entry'     -- String comparison on 3.3M rows!
  AND taggings.tag_id IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  -- Multiple tag lookups
)
```

---

## üí° Recommended Solution

### Phase 1: Implement Direct Associations (Week 1-2)

**Create direct Entry ‚Üí Topic relationships:**

```ruby
# Instead of:
Entry ‚Üí Taggings (3.3M rows) ‚Üí Tags ‚Üí Topics  # Slow polymorphic JOIN

# Use:
Entry ‚Üí EntryTopics (200K rows) ‚Üí Topics      # Fast foreign key
```

**Benefits:**
- Direct foreign key (indexed, fast)
- No polymorphic string matching
- Much smaller join table (200K vs 3.3M rows)
- Rails-idiomatic associations

### Phase 2: Test & Validate (Week 3)

**Compare performance:**
- Current (ES): ~30-40ms
- Current (MySQL tagged_with): 440ms
- New (direct associations): Expected 50-100ms

**Monitor:**
- Query times drop 88%
- No errors
- Data accuracy 100%

### Phase 3: Remove Elasticsearch (Week 4-5)

**Once direct associations proven:**
- Remove `searchkick` from models
- Remove gems from Gemfile
- Stop ES service
- **Save 33.6GB RAM**

## üìä Expected Outcomes

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Current (ES) | After Optimization | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Query Time** | 30-40ms | 50-100ms | Similar |
| **Query Time (no ES)** | 440ms | 50-100ms | **88% faster** |
| **RAM Usage** | +33.6GB | 0GB | **-33.6GB** |
| **System Complexity** | High | Medium | **Simpler** |
| **Code Quality** | Workaround | Direct associations | **Better** |

### Storage Requirements

| Component | Size | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **EntryTopics table** | ~5MB | 200K rows |
| **FacebookEntryTopics** | ~1MB | 30K rows |
| **TwitterPostTopics** | ~500KB | 10K rows |
| **Total** | **~6.5MB** | vs 33.6GB for ES! |

## üóìÔ∏è Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Preparation (5 hours)
- [ ] Create migration for join tables
- [ ] Update models with associations
- [ ] Add sync callbacks
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Run backfill on staging
- [ ] Verify data accuracy

### Week 2: Production Deployment (hands-off)
- [ ] Deploy new associations to production
- [ ] Run backfill job (2-4 hours, monitored)
- [ ] Keep using Elasticsearch (no query changes)
- [ ] Verify associations are correct

### Week 3: Incremental Switch (2 hours)
- [ ] Update ONE query method (`list_entries`)
- [ ] Monitor performance closely
- [ ] Compare times: ES vs direct associations
- [ ] If good (50-100ms), proceed
- [ ] If bad, rollback easily

### Week 4: Full Migration (4 hours)

## üìã Key Decisions

### ‚úÖ DO

1. **Implement direct Entry-Topic associations**
   - Eliminates expensive polymorphic JOIN
   - Proper Rails pattern
   - 88% performance improvement

2. **Keep Elasticsearch running during migration**
   - Safety net
   - Easy rollback
   - No user impact

3. **Gradual rollout**
   - Test one method first
   - Validate performance
   - Monitor closely

4. **Backfill carefully**
   - Use background jobs
   - Batch processing
   - Throttle to avoid DB overload

### ‚ùå DON'T

1. **Don't remove ES before fixing tagging**
   - Would make queries 10x slower (440ms)
   - Users would notice
   - Bad experience

2. **Don't rush the migration**
   - Take 4-5 weeks
   - Test thoroughly
   - Monitor at each stage

3. **Don't skip the backfill**
   - Data integrity critical
   - Test on staging first
   - Verify accuracy

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Backfill Takes Too Long

**Mitigation:**
- Run during off-hours
- Use background jobs
- Can pause/resume safely
- Won't affect current queries (ES still working)

### Risk 2: Direct Associations Slower Than Expected

**Likelihood:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Test on staging first
- Compare with production ES times
- Easy rollback (keep ES running)
- Can optimize indexes if needed

### Risk 3: Data Sync Issues

**Mitigation:**
- Callbacks handle automatic syncing
- Can manually re-sync if needed
- Verify associations during backfill
- Test thoroughly on staging

## üéì Lessons Learned

### Why Local Testing Missed This

1. **Scale matters:** 1K taggings vs 3.3M taggings = 3,000x difference
2. **Polymorphic JOINs don't scale:** Fine at small scale, terrible at large scale
3. **Always test on production-like data:** Local can't replicate production behavior

### Why Elasticsearch Seemed Like Solution

1. **Bypasses the JOIN:** Returns IDs directly
2. **Appears faster:** 30ms vs 440ms
3. **But:** Treating symptom, not disease
4. **And:** Costs 33.6GB RAM

### The Right Solution

1. **Fix root cause:** Replace polymorphic with direct associations
2. **Then remove ES:** Get speed + save RAM
3. **Result:** Best of both worlds
